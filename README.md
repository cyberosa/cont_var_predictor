## Goal of the project

We have a dataset with different unknown features and the goal is to predict the so-called completion rate (how many submissions per total views). The idea is to build a supervised model to achieve that.
### Strategy
After the exploration, try different regressor models from sklearn and compare them to select the best one.

## API
It will be built a REST API to send requests and get predictions. Postman is used to test the client end.

## Testing
Some basic unittests are proposed. However building a more robust testing framework is a TODO task for the future.
